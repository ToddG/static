# static

This is a repository to hold resources that I have found on the web or elsewhere. 
These are resources that I want to be able to use and link to in other documents, code, PR's etc.

## initial use case

REPRO:
* download a datasheet
* expand the datasheet to text
* upload both the datasheet and the text version
* link to a line number in the text version in a separate code project/PR/etc.
